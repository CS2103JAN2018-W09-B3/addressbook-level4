== Introduction

Codeducator is a desktop address book application for private programming language tutors who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing the contacts of students*. You can also use Codeducator to track the progress of your students, manage your tutoring schedule and other important information about your students. More importantly, Codeducator is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Codeducator can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start
